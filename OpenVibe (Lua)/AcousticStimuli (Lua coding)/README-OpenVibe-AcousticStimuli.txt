You can run the OpenVibe scenario without connecting an EEG device by setting the Generic Oscillator onto the Acquisition Server. Random EEG signal will be generated.

Channels can be referenced by loading the "ChannelsLabels" file into the Driver Properties, after indicating 32 sensors.

You can see the stimulation labels in real time on the EEG data. Stimulation codes are available at: https://openvibe.inria.fr/stimulation-codes/
